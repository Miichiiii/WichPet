Interactive Pet Comparison Site
A responsive web tool that clearly compares the key needs and costs of six popular pets (dogs, cats, mice, birds, rabbits, and fish). Ideal for anyone who wants to get informed before purchasing.

Core Features:

Comparison table with initial and monthly costs, time required, space required, life expectancy, care and training requirements, temperament, suitability, and noise level.

Interactive charts: bar chart for costs, pie chart for time distribution.

Filter and sort by any criteria (e.g., lowest cost, lowest maintenance required).
